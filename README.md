# eventListenersv2 - Problem set focusing on Event Listeners

## Lessons Learned
* sometimes creating a state to monitor is useful
```
var navState = { //creating an object that has teh default state of the navMenu
	isShowing: true,
}
```
* eventlisteners include actions such as 'click', 'keydown' (where keyCode 13 is equal to the ENTER button), etc...
